Hello this is the repository of Eduardo Hernandez. In here I just have pieces of code I have been working on.
I am a beginner but am currently working to improve my HTML, CSS, and JS skill.
In the future I will probably incorporate other coding languages, but for now this repo will
just be coding for websites.
